*Note: Since I don't have any of the appropriate boilerplate/about in place yet - I work for Microsoft, and this blog is my own thoughts, not anyone elses.*

Turns out I'm not particularly good at writing stuff down. This blog is my effort to change that.

Why Octopress
-------------
I'm a pretty technical person - on average I probably spend 20+ hours a week writing code (lucky me, I know!) for Microsoft, or personal prjects, and it would be really easy for me to get sucked into writing a blogging platform (or starting to writing a blogging platform, and get tired of it), and never actually, you know, do any blogging. I knew when I started out that I needed a simple, lightweight platform to blog on. While I've done a considerable amount of development for WordPress, and I've checked out platforms like Ghost, I knew I wanted something even simpler Realistically, I wanted a solution that was simple for me to setup, but easy enough to move to what I wanted later.

Enter [Octopress](http://octopress.org). I knew I was going to host on github pages (or some git backed platform), so I tried a couple of custom solutions (grunt + jade etc.) After an evening of exploration, I realized I was getting sucked down the "tech blackhole" and decided I couldn't invest that much more time in scaffolding my own stuff. So at the suggestion of my good friend [Willi.am](http://willi.am), and after being assured that installing ruby on Windows wasn't as painful as it used to be, I decided to give it a shot.

The main problem that octopress solves (in my mind - I understand that it has other benefits) is that GitHub pages require that the content be static - which means that if you want anything more than a little complex, everything has to be generated offline. It also provides a fairly complete scaffold, so I can start generating content quickly.

I also appreciate that I can write all of my content in markdown - markdown isn't my favorite way to write prettier text (yet?), but it's simple, functional, and can be easily versioned. That means that I can accept pull requests from people who find issues/want to contribute to my content. It also means that if I move to another platform that accepts markdown, I'm pretty much set. (It's also easy to just render to html and keep it that way, if I need to.)

Going Forward
-------------
Eventually, I hope to revisit other systems - honestly, I'm not particularly enthusiastic about using ruby. Nothing against it, it's just another tool, and I don't really have any projects in mind for it, and I'm not currently using it for any other projects. Realistically, I'd much rather be building on [nodejs](http://nodejs.org), since that's where I'm looking to broaden my current skills.

The site still has a ways to go technically - if nothing else, I need to actually do some styling (what, you don't *love* the default theme?!) and figure out getting comments enabled. Content wise, I should write a little bit about myself (so I can read it when I forget), and generate some real content. Going forward I hope to have a mix of technical, and "professional" posts.
